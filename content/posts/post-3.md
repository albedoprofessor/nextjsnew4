## Why Dark Mode?

At Wikipedia, we understand that reading for extended periods can be more comfortable and less straining on the eyes when the background is darker. That's why we introduced Dark Mode to provide our users with an alternative reading experience that's easy on the eyes, especially in low-light environments.

## How to Activate Dark Mode

Activating Dark Mode on Wikipedia is a breeze:

1. **Log in (optional):** If you have a Wikipedia account, log in to enjoy Dark Mode consistently across devices.

2. **Visit Wikipedia:** Navigate to Wikipedia's website.

3. **Enable Dark Mode:** Look for the Dark Mode toggle switch, usually located in the top right corner of the screen. Click or tap it to switch to Dark Mode.

4. **Enjoy Nighttime Reading:** Once activated, Dark Mode will transform the background to a darker color, making it easier to read articles in dimly lit environments.

## Benefits of Wikipedia Dark Mode

- **Reduced Eye Strain:** Dark Mode's lower contrast and reduced brightness can help reduce eye strain during prolonged reading sessions.

- **Battery Savings:** For users on devices with OLED or AMOLED screens, Dark Mode can save battery life by using less power to display dark colors.

- **Improved Focus:** Dark Mode minimizes distractions and allows you to concentrate on the content you're reading.

- **Enhanced Aesthetics:** Many users find the sleek and modern look of Dark Mode appealing.
